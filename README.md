# Various factorization and length set functions for numerical semigroups

This file contains the various functions that were used to compare runtimes for calculating factorizations and length sets of elements in a numerical semigroup. 
The results of the tests are documented in [this paper](https://gilad-moskowitz.github.io/dynamicAlgs.pdf).
